💼 Sachin's Portfolio Website

Hi there! 👋
Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. This site is designed to showcase who I am, what I do, and the projects I’ve worked on.

🧑‍💻 About the Website

This is a simple yet fully responsive portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It highlights:

👋 A brief introduction about me
🛠️ My technical skills
💼 Projects I’ve worked on
📬 A contact section with a working form layout
I created this portfolio to have a central place where recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers can learn more about me and my work. It’s also a personal project to practice and showcase my front-end development skills.

🧰 Tech Stack

Here’s what I used to build the website:

HTML5 – Structure of the pages
CSS3 – Styling, layout, and responsiveness
JavaScript – For basic interactivity
Font Awesome – For icons
Google Fonts – For typography
The site is fully responsive and works smoothly on all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.
